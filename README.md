# KloudBuilder: Community-Driven AWS Learning

Welcome to KloudBuilder, an open-source initiative aimed at creating a comprehensive, structured learning path for Amazon Web Services (AWS).

## Mission

KloudBuilder is dedicated to democratizing AWS learning by providing free, community-driven content structured in a clear, progressive manner. We believe in the power of collective knowledge and aim to create a platform where learners and experts can come together to share, learn, and grow.

## How It Works

We've organized our content into levels, from 0 to 10, each representing increasing complexity and depth of AWS knowledge:

- **Level 0**: Fundamental knowledge (no hands-on projects)
- **Levels 1-2**: Cloud Practitioner level
- **Levels 3-5**: Associate level
- **Levels 6-8**: Professional level
- **Levels 9-10**: Specialty and advanced topics

Each level can contain multiple:
- Projects
- Labs
- Blog posts
- Video tutorials
- Architecture diagrams

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community! Here's how you can help:

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Create** your content in the appropriate level directory
3. **Submit** a pull request with your changes

Please ensure your contributions adhere to the following guidelines:

- If submitting a project or lab, include a README with setup instructions

## Future Plans
